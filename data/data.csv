The partnership is designed to advance Zimbabwe's use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, increasing security and improving efficiency at entry points while also assisting in disaster response and traffic control. The project faces opposition in Zimbabwe and raises concerns about the potential for the technology to be used to suppress dissent. Hikvision's collaboration with Zimbabwe is one facet of growing ties between China and Zimbabwe on AI and surveillance technology. Shortly before the MoU was signed, the two countries agreed to <a href=""https://archive.fo/rHzu1"">cooperate</a> on a smart city project in the city of Mutare. China has also donated facial recognition equipment that will be used in Zimbabwe's border posts, state entry points and airports. Zimbabwe is reportedly building partnerships on big data and AI technology with Chinese universities. See our ""<a href=""https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-chinas-tech-giants"">Mapping China's technology giants</a>"" report for a longer case study on the Hikvision smart city project.</p>
<p>China's influence over Zimbabwe, a fellow authoritarian state, is substantial. China is believed to have played a role in the <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics-mugabe-specialrepor/special-report-treacherous-shenanigans-the-inside-story-of-mugabes-downfall-idUSKBN1DQ0AG"">November 2017 coup</a> that ousted Robert Mugabe. Generals and politicians involved in the coup are believed to have planned it during a trip to China, where they discussed their intentions with the Chinese Defence Minister.</p>","","TRUE","","","6 | Surveillance","7 | State controlling stake","","","","","","11 | Smart City-Public Security project245 | Zimbabwe","17 | MoU-agreement245 | Zimbabwe","2 | Smart cities245 | Zimbabwe","1 | Artificial Intelligence245 | Zimbabwe","6 | Surveillance245 | Zimbabwe","12 | Hikvision245 | Zimbabwe","","","",""

It offers cable head access to Djibouti Telecom's landing station, which connects to more than half a dozen submarine cables, including AAE1 (Asia&ndash;Africa&ndash;Europe), SMW3 (Southeast Asia &ndash; Middle East &ndash; Western Europe) and SMW5, as well as China's own Pakistan East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable project.</p>
<p>The DDC also houses the Djibouti Internet Exchange (DjIX).</p>
<p>An agreement between China Mobile and the DDC extends beyond just the use of rack space in its COLO. It is also likely to use the DjIX to connect networks with other operators and extend their content delivery network using the <a href=""https://techerati.com/the-stack-archive/data-centre/2017/09/05/china-mobile-selects-djibouti-data-center-for-african-expansion/"">cable head access</a> at the landing station.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20181002/https://allafrica.com/stories/201810020271.html"">DDC's CEO</a>, the company also has a relationship with China Unicom. It is not clear whether this is a direct connection or an indirect one, via the PEACE cable project or via its investment in a Hong Kong telco, PCCW, which has <a href=""https://www.telecomasia.net/content/pccw-global-connects-djibouti-data-center"">announced its use of the DDC for colocation and cable access</a>.</p>
<p>A direct connection would be the DDC providing cross-connect services, which would allow China Unicom to reduce costs and connect to foreign partner networks that are also using the DDC.</p>
<p>Additionally, DDC's cable head access would allow China Unicom to connect to the PEACE cable and the SEAMEW-5 and AAE-1 undersea cables.</p>
<p>Some operators with partnerships with Chinese telcos that are also in the DDC include MTN (Africa), Tata (India), EITC/Du (UAE) and PCCW (Hong Kong) <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20181002/https://allafrica.com/stories/201810020271.html"">Source</a>.</p>

It offers cable head access to Djibouti Telecom's landing station (located only metres away) that has access to more than half a dozen submarine cables, including the Asia&ndash;Africa&ndash;Europe (AAE1), Southeast Asia &ndash; Middle East &ndash; Western Europe (SEAMEW-3) and SEAMEW-5 cables, as well as China's own Pakistan East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable project. Furthermore, DDC houses the<a href=""http://www.djiboutidatacenter.com/en/page/djibouti-internet-exchange-djix""> Djibouti Internet Exchange (DjIX).</a></p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/telecoms-en/44062/djibouti-data-centres-john-melick-iii-on-two-new-international-cable-connections-for-the-region-and-operating-neutral-third-party-combined-landing-stations-and-data-centres"">DDC's CEO</a>, China Unicom has a relationship with the DDC. However, it is not clear what kind of relationship that is, whether this link is indirect via the PEACE cable project or via its investment in Hong Kong telco, PCCW (which <a href=""https://www.telecomasia.net/content/pccw-global-connects-djibouti-data-center"">has announced</a><a> </a>its use of the DDC for co-location and cable access), or a direct link. It is likely that there is a direct connection, as the DDC provides cross-connect services, which would allow China Unicom to reduce costs and connect to foreign partner networks that are also using the DDC. Additionally, with DDC's cable head access, this would allow China Unicom to connect into the PEACE cable and the SEAMEW-5 and AAE-1 undersea cables.</p>

<p>The building of the Nwge Saung Cable Landing Station was the result of an agreement between China Unicom and Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). The landing station was significant enough in the bilateral relationship between China and Myanmar that the agreement was witnessed by China&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, and Myanmar&rsquo;s then-President, U Thein Sein, at the presidential palace in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. Although China Unicom partnered with MPT to build the landing station, the station is <a href=""http://www.chinaunicom.com.cn/issue/detail-gsma8.html"">fully funded</a> by China Unicom. It is also China Unicom's first overseas cable landing station.</p>","","TRUE","","","1 | Telecommunications","1 | State-owned enterprise","","","","","","8 | Data centre143 | Myanmar [Burma]","143 | Myanmar [Burma]","143 | Myanmar [Burma]","143 | Myanmar [Burma]","143 | Myanmar [Burma]","7 | China Unicom143 | Myanmar [Burma]","","","",""

Ltd (中国&mdash;东盟信息港股份有限公司, 中国东信), which is a State Council-approved, state-owned company of which it is the <a href=""http://www.gsxt.gov.cn"">majority shareholder (45%)</a>. In 2017, that company and Tropic Science Co. Ltd, using financing from the China Construction Bank, were the key investors behind the PEACE cable project (丝路国际海缆网络系统项目, PEACE项目), which is part of China&rsquo;s Belt and Road Initiative. It is an undersea cable that was expected to be ready for service in the first quarter of 2020. In November 2020, PEACE <a href=""http://www.peacecable.net/news/Detail/16623#:~:text=PEACE%20submarine%20cable%20system%2C%20connecting,targeted%20for%20completion%20in%202021."">announced</a> that the first cable loading the Mediterranean Segment was successfully completed.

<p>After its completion, the cable will be the <a href=""http://www.peacecable.net/News/Detail/16588"">shortest length and latency</a> route connecting China with Africa and Europe. That will not only provide China with high-speed access to Africa, but also link the country&rsquo;s <a href=""https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/chinas-experiment-in-djibouti/"">assets in Africa</a> back to China. It will land in Djibouti, where the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA) has a naval base. The PEACE cable also lands in Gwadar, Pakistan, where it will <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190412082311/https://www.submarinenetworks.com/zh/cables/2018083001"">connect with</a> the China&ndash;Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Gwadar has long been <a href=""https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/chinas-new-network-indian-ocean-base"">speculated about</a>&nbsp;as a likely site for a PLA Navy and Air Force base. It has been reported that the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190412082357/http://www.huaweimarine.com/zh/News/2018/press-releases/pr20181022"">construction of this cable</a> will also improve the quality of local network services in Somalia and the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is unclear what happened in the months between the start of the project and October 2018, when the laying of the cable started, but ownership of the project had shifted from state-owned China&ndash;ASEAN Information Harbor and Tropical Science to PEACE Cable International Network Co.

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-technicians-helped-african-governments-spy-on-political-opponents-11565793017"">Wall Street Journal</a> (WSJ), in May 2018 Uganda and Huawei signed a US$126 million deal for a &lsquo;safe cities&rsquo; project. Uganda paid US$16.3 million up front and used a US$104 million Standard Chartered Bank loan. According to the Financial Times, on 21 August 2019 <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/e20580de-c35f-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9"">Ugandan police confirmed</a> that Huawei was rolling out a safe city initiative in Uganda in response to the WSJ investigation. The system includes facial recognition and AI software and closed-circuit television cameras nationwide.</p>
<p>On 15 August 2019, the WSJ <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-technicians-helped-african-governments-spy-on-political-opponents-11565793017"">reported</a> that Huawei technicians helped intelligence officials in Uganda to spy on their political opponents, &lsquo;including intercepting their encrypted communications and social media, and using cell data to track their whereabouts&rsquo;. According to the report, Huawei engineers helped Ugandan intelligence officers to penetrate the communications of a key political opponent. This reportedly led to the arrest of the politician and some of his supporters. Uganda&rsquo;s government confirmed that Huawei was providing technical support to Uganda's intelligence community and police, but declined to comment on the spying allegations. Huawei denied the allegations.</p>
<p>According to the WSJ investigation, President Museveni directed his then police chief to approach the Chinese Communist Party for assistance with digital surveillance in 2017, in response to protests. In September 2017, senior Ugandan security officials went to Algiers to study the country's video surveillance system, on the advice of Huawei. In 2017, Ugandan police officers also received technical training in Beijing. Huawei technicians were seconded to train local staff on how to use Huawei technology for Uganda&rsquo;s first cyber unit, opened in November 2018.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the first phase of the project would connect 83 police stations in the capital. There are plans to expand it to another 271 police stations. Huawei has also assisted in the construction of 11 monitoring systems and a forthcoming US$30 mullion hub. The hub is to be linked to 5,000 of the company&rsquo;s cameras equipped with facial recognition technology.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe will send biometric data on millions of its citizens to China as part of an arrangement that had no input from ordinary Zimbabwean citizens. The data is hoped to help improve CloudWalk&rsquo;s facial recognition systems for people with dark skin.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Christopher Mutsvangwa, a former Zimbabwean Ambassador to China, told Zimbabwe&rsquo;s <em>The Herald </em>newspaper that Zimbabwe had recently received donations of facial recognition terminals from CloudWalk.</p>
<p>Mutsvangwa said the facial recognition terminals were currently being installed in all the country's border posts and points of entry for smoother passenger processing.</p>
<p>""China has proved to be our all-weather friend and this time around, we have approached them to spearhead our AI revolution in Zimbabwe,"" Mutsvangwa told the paper.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Herald</em>, Zimbabwe signed another agreement with CloudWalk in April 2019 that saw the Chinese firm provide facial recognition for smart financial service networks, as well as intelligent security applications at airports and railway and bus stations.</p>
<p>The new deal, according to the paper, was reached during a visit to China by Zimbabwean President Mnangagwa and forms part of China's Belt and Road Initiative in Africa.</p>

In March 2019, the Mandalay regional government <a href=""https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/analysis/amid-intl-espionage-concerns-mandalay-embrace-huawei-safe-city-project.html"">announced a safe city project</a> for Mandalay in cooperation with Huawei. At the Mandalay Economic Forum, The Mandalay Region Chief Minister, U Zaw Myint Maung, said that the Safe City plan was important for the rule of law and security, which would subsequently attract more investment.</p>
<p>Huawei is expected to provide the project for $US1.25 million. <a href=""https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/huawei-supply-mandalays-safe-city-project-cameras-security-equipment.html"">The Irrawaddy reported</a> that Huawei would provide the surveillance cameras (equipped with AI and facial recognition technology) and &lsquo;other security equipment&rsquo; for the project. Initially, the cameras will be installed in Mandalay&rsquo;s Maha Aung Myay, Chan Mya Thazi and Pyi Gyi Tagun townships. Those townships were chosen due to their &lsquo;relatively high crime rate&rsquo;, identified in a survey conducted by local police and Huawei.</p>
<p>A 9 May 2019, an Irawaddy article <a href=""https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/huawei-supply-mandalays-safe-city-project-cameras-security-equipment.html"">stated</a> that the regional government would sign a deal with Huawei the following month. However, a 19 June 2019 article <a href=""https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/analysis/amid-intl-espionage-concerns-mandalay-embrace-huawei-safe-city-project.html"">said</a> that the agreement still had not been signed and that the project was being reviewed by the Union government. Mandalay Region Chief Minister U Zaw Myint Maung said that the government was reviewing the project following concerns about Huawei&rsquo;s tensions with the US and data privacy concerns. A union-level official <a href=""https://theworldnews.net/mm-news/cctv-contract-with-huawei-will-guard-against-spying-mandalay-chief-minister"">anonymously said</a> that they thought the regional government should reconsider the Huawei partnership. The project is also being reviewed at the regional level. U Zaw Myint Maung <a href=""https://www.mmtimes.com/news/mandalay-project-telco-under-review-says-chief-minister.html"">said</a>, &lsquo;We will review the criticism, as alternative technologies could be used for the project and no formal agreement has been signed for the project.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href=""https://theworldnews.net/mm-news/cctv-contract-with-huawei-will-guard-against-spying-mandalay-chief-minister"">Reportedly</a>, the regional government awarded the contract to Huawei with no tender process. Many in Mandalay admit that the city has a r<a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3021415/how-myanmars-ancient-city-mandalay-has-embraced-rapid"">ange of problems that could be partly alleviated by better use of technology</a>, such as water management and traffic congestion, but local activists are trying to highlight concerns about data privacy and the ability of the systems to be used for increased surveillance.</p>
<p>In the first week of July 2019, the <a href=""https://theworldnews.net/mm-news/cctv-contract-with-huawei-will-guard-against-spying-mandalay-chief-minister"">regional government submitted a draft contract</a> to the President&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office, saying that it was being extremely careful and had included important provisions in the contract to safeguard against spying. There was particular scrutiny of the language of the contract after &lsquo;the Union Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office found that the Chinese side had added new clauses to the Chinese-language version of an agreement establishing a sister city relationship between Mandalay and China&rsquo;s Xianxi some months ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mandalay already has a surveillance camera system in place, with 130 cameras. The city also <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3021415/how-myanmars-ancient-city-mandalay-has-embraced-rapid"">reportedly</a> has an Australian-made traffic control system.</p>
<p>In September 2019,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.mmtimes.com/news/mandalay-receives-smart-city-award.html"">Mandalay received the Smart City Award 2019</a> from the Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organization.
